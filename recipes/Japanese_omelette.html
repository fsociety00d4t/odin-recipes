        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 4 eggs</li>
            <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>cooking oil as needed</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Beat the eggs: </strong><br>
                First, beat 4 eggs well in a bowl using either a fork, or chopsticks if you are an expert chopstick user.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add seasonings:</strong> <br>
                Add one tablespoon each of soy sauce, mirin and sugar and a little salt to your mix.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Heat up a pan: </strong> <br>
            Put a small amount of cooking oil in your pan and bring it up to medium heat. <br>
             Keep some kitchen roll handy to help keep the pan oiled during cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Cook the eggs:</strong> <br>
               Add a small amount of your egg mix into the heated pan. <br>
               Once the egg has cooked slightly so that the top is still slightly uncooked, push it over to the side of your pan.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Add a little more oil to the pan using the kitchen roll: </strong> <br>
               Add another small amount of the egg mix to your pan. <br>
               Again, wait for this to cook a little, but before it sets on top. <br> 
               You can then begin to roll the first bit of egg over the mix you just put in the pan until you have a small roll of egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repeat the steps: </strong> <br>
                Continue adding a small amount of egg while oiling the pan each time in between. <br>
                As you add more egg and roll it up each time, your egg roll will start getting larger and easier to add new layers. <br>
                Keep adding the egg in new layers until you have used it all up.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Slice the tamagoyaki:</strong> <br>
                Your tamagoyaki is now finished so remove from the pan and wait to cool before slicing it up into thin pieces with a sharp knife.
            </li>
        </ol>
