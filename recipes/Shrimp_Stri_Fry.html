    <h1>Shrimp Stri Fry</h1>

    <img src="shrimp_stir_fry.png" > 
    <h3> Easy, fast and Healthy!</h3>
    <p>Traditionally, stir-fries are cooked in a wok over extremely high heat. <br>
        While it’s impossible to replicate that in a home kitchen, a cast iron skillet 
        is the next best thing. <br>
        Read on for more top tips on how to make this easy one-pot dinner.</p>
    <p>Stir-frying is a fast-paced cooking method, which means there’s no time to be doing any prep work once you start cooking. <br>
        You’ll want to make sure all of your ingredients are prepped and ready (we’d even suggest 
        stirring together the sauce in advance) before you turn on the heat. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 tbsp. extra-virgin</li>
